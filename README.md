# Open Source Electron Microscopy

This repository contains the content for the website of the Open Source Electron Microscopy organization. The website is deployed directly from the root directory on the `main` branch, and is rebuilt automatically through a github Action workflow when new commits are pushed to `main`. The site is built with Jekyll, using the Just the Docs theme.
